Glyphs-Scripts
==============

## RedCircles.py

This script searches for control points that are overlapping nodes and marks them with an annotation circle, setting also glyph's color to red.
###How to use:
Select the glyphs and run the script. It works for one master at a time.
###Note:
An advanced and much better tool to perform this is RedArrows by Jens Kutilek (https://github.com/jenskutilek/RedArrow-Glyphs) but it only works on Glpyhs 2.
